# Directory Analysis
## Overview
This directory contains the source code for a command-line tool named Babar. Babar is an intelligent codebase analysis tool that uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to analyze a directory of code files and generate a markdown document summarizing the directory's purpose, components, architecture, conventions, refactoring opportunities, and technical debt. The tool is designed to help developers understand and improve their codebase.

## Components
analyser.js: This is the core module of the tool. It contains functions for building a directory tree, ignoring certain paths, determining relevant files, reading .aimd files, and analyzing directories with AI.
app.js: This is a React component that provides a command-line interface for the tool. It displays the progress of the analysis and the directories currently being analyzed.
cli.js: This is the entry point of the tool. It uses the meow library to parse command-line arguments and the ink library to render the React component.
config.js: This module contains the default configuration for the tool and a function to load the configuration from environment variables or a .babarrc.json file.

## Architecture
The tool starts by building a directory tree of the target directory, ignoring certain paths and only including relevant files. It then analyzes each directory in the tree, starting from the deepest. For each directory, it reads the contents of the relevant files and any child .aimd files, and sends a prompt to the OpenAI API to generate a summary. The summary is then written to a .aimd file in the directory. The tool uses a React component to display the progress of the analysis and the directories currently being analyzed.

## Conventions
The tool follows standard JavaScript conventions and uses modern JavaScript features such as async/await and ES modules. It also uses the zod library for schema validation and the ink library for command-line interface rendering.

## Refactoring Opportunities
The tool could benefit from more modularization. For example, the functions for building the directory tree and analyzing directories could be moved to separate modules.
The tool could also benefit from more error handling. For example, it currently does not handle errors that occur during the analysis of a directory.

## Technical Debt
The tool currently does not support analyzing subdirectories. This could be a limitation for large codebases with complex directory structures. Additionally, the tool does not have any tests, which could make it difficult to maintain and improve in the future.
