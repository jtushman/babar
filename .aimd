6. Organization and Use of Subdirectories:

The application has a single subdirectory named 'source'. This folder contains the main codebase of the application, organized into separate files based on their functionalities. It seems that this directory follows a common practice in Node.js projects where the source code is separated from the rest of the project files, making it easier for developers to navigate and understand the structure of the application. 

The `source` directory has a file named `app.js` that is imported and tested in the main `test.js` file. This indicates that the tool uses a test-driven development (TDD) approach, where code functionality is validated through tests. In this case, the `test.js` file in the root directory is used to test the components defined in the `source` directory.
